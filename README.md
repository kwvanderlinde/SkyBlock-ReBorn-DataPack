# SkyBlock ReBorn DataPack

This datapack offers three aspects that enhance the SkyBlock experience without deviating too far from Vanilla mechanics:
1. Custom Advancements
2. Custom Mob Drops
3. Custom Recipes

## Custom Advancements

The vanilla advancement tree has been completely replaced with one that guides the player through the SkyBlock ReBorn experience. When in doubt, the advancement tree can provide some handy inspiration for what to do.

## Custom Mob Drops

The two boss mobs (Wither and Ender Dragon) have custom loot tables to grant items that are otherwise not obtainable or renewable.

The Ender Dragon is will always drop a lava bucket upon death. This is the only way to obtain more lava without duping.

The Wither now has a 50% chance to drop one piece of ancient debris when killed by a player. Since ancient debris can normally only be found by mining in the Nether, and there aren't any blocks left in the Nether, this will be the only source of ancient debris, making netherite tools and armor even more expensive then in vanilla minecraft.

## Custom Recipes

There are some interesting blocks that cannot be achieved in SkyBlock ReBorn using purely vanilla crafting mechanics. We've added recipes for them that just make sense and add a little bit of expansion to the experience. You'll find that blackstone can be crafted from basalt and stone, and that coral and coral fans can be crafted into the corresponding coral block.
